Title: Perceptron model for only a pair of inputs and its targeted output

This is the perceptron model which was proposed by Rosenblatt.

It is a more general computational model than MP neuron model.

This code generates output with respect to only one case at a time i.e., "(x1,x2)" are the inputs which produces a targeted output "t"

In this code if you want to assign your own weights then you can do it when the output window shows do you want to change weights.

You can cross verify you weights to check if the new weights are satisfying the whole functional bi-polar table
